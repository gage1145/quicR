              the medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RPLN) or obex are
              considered diagnostic gold standards for prion detection.
              However, differences in CWD transmission, stage of infection,
              pathogenesis, and strain can limit performance. To overcome these
              uncertainties, we used Bayesian statistics to assess the accuracy
              of RT-QuIC, an increasingly used prion amplification assay, to
              diagnose CWD on tonsil (TLN), parotid (PLN) and submandibular
              lymph nodes (SMLN), and ELISA/IHC on RPLN of white-tailed deer
              (WTD) sampled from Minnesota. Dichotomous RT-QuIC and ELISA/IHC
              results from wild (n = 61) and captive (n = 46) WTD were analyzed
              with two-dependent-test, one-population models. RT-QuIC performed
              on TLN and SMLN of the wild WTD population had similar
              sensitivity (median range (MR): 92.2-95.1) to ELISA/IHC on RPLN
              (MR: 91.1-92.3). Slightly lower (4-7\%) sensitivity estimates
              were obtained from farmed animal and PLN models. RT-QuIC
              specificity estimates were high (MR: 94.5-98.5\%) and similar to
              ELISA/IHC estimates (MR: 95.7-97.6\%) in all models. This study
              offers new insights on RT-QuIC and ELISA/IHC performance at the

abstract = {Motivation: Fluorophore-assisted seed amplification assays (F-SAAs), such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and fluorophore-assisted protein misfolding cyclic amplification (F-PMCA), have become indispensable tools for studying protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. However, analyzing data generated by these techniques often requires complex and time-consuming manual processes. In addition, the lack of standardization in F-SAA data analysis presents a significant challenge to the interpretation and reproducibility of F-SAA results across different laboratories and studies. There is a need for automated, standardized analysis tools that can efficiently process F-SAA data while ensuring consistency and reliability across different research settings. Results: Here, we present QuICSeedR (pronounced as "quick seeder"), an R package that addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive toolkit for the automated processing, analysis, and visualization of F-SAA data. Importantly, QuICSeedR also establishes the foundation for building an F-SAA data management and analysis framework, enabling more consistent and comparable results across different research groups.},
