# quicR 1.0.3

-   Added janitor as a dependency.
-   Added a new test file which includes multiple real-time datasets. This is useful for the get_real function since the output returns a list of data frames if there are multiple real-time reads.
-   Converted many of the functions to be more in line with functional programming paradigm.
-   Included a documentation file that fixes the NOTE when using "." in a dplyr pipeline.
-   Fixed bugs in the example scripts.
